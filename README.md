# Assignment 3
Lab Description :   Pass in a matrix and return a list that contains the total values of each row.



Sample Data : 
{{1,2,3},{5,5,5,5}}
{{1,2,3},{5},{1},{2,2}};
{{1,2},{5,5},{5,5},{4,5,6,7},{123124,12312}};


Sample Output : 
Row totals are :: [6, 20]
Row totals are :: [6, 5, 1, 4]
Row totals are :: [3, 10, 10, 22, 135436]
